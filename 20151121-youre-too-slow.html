            <p>Warning, this is going to seem like a sour-grapes post about failing a job interview. Well yep that's exactly what it is. Recently, I interviewed with a well-known software company. Working for them would have been cool because I admire their work and the stuff they've done for the internet in general.</p>
<p>The requirements for the job I applied for didn't specify expertise in the languages mentioned (C++, JavaScript) and explicitly mentioned a CS degree wasn't necessary. After two computational physics degrees I should be a good programmer (in my entirely objective opinion) and had experience in C++/JS so thought I had a decent chance. Not a fantastic one, but decent. Off goes my application and to my pleasant surprise I get a response within 24 hours, a rare occurrence in job hunting. The recruiter liked my experience with statistics and data analysis. Ok, cool.</p>
<p>My first task was an online coding screen, presumably to weed out people who had no experience in C++ or JS. Still, I practised for it over a weekend to make sure I wasn't caught out. Specifically, I brushed up on all the new developments that had come with C++14. In the end the screen wasn't too bad. Four questions in all: one what's-wrong-with-this-code question, a JS regular expressions question (eugh) and two C++ questions. Now I feel like I exploited the C++ standard library a lot for the latter questions but I was on a deadline and didn't think rewriting readily available algorithms was a great plan. Isn't that one thing that's drilled into programmers? Use established, field-tested libraries before rolling your own? The deadline for the coding screen was specified in the recruiter's email: 24 hours hard time limit, good coders take a couple hours but great coders do it in &lt;90 minutes. Using the standard library, I managed the latter but man it felt a bit dirty.</p>
<p>Completing the code screen got me a phone call from a recruiter who told me how the rest of the procedure would go. Unfortunately, it also sounded like their European workplaces were being shrunk and new recruits would be primarily remote. This put me off a bit, I might say why in a later post. Most devs seem to be alright with remote work though. What I had in store seemed a bit harrowing: two 45-minute technical webcam interviews and if I made it through those, a 6-hour on-site interview day in their office overseas. Wow. Well at least they're rigorous, right?</p>
<p>My technical webcam sessions were scheduled back to back. Since my interviewers were based in North America, they took place in my evening. They didn't use Skype so I had to install some other odd bit of software. The first interviewer showed up, a bit late. I was nervous but had already received a job offer elsewhere so my fate didn't rest with these interviews. After a minimum of introductions, we dove into the task. I was shown an HTML page with some embedded JS and told to review the code for any problems. Now JavaScript, at the best of times is an easy language to use badly. There were <em>plenty</em> of issues with this code, that I discussed with the interviewer. But it was never made clear if there was an end goal or how in-depth the discussion over each problem should be. It kept feeling like I was meant to make some grand statement that would make the interviewer clap with joy and move on. Well, I never found out if there were further questions because our time ran out with little or no feedback from the interviewer. Oh well, time for the next one.</p>
<p>The next interviewer was late, so we rushed into the task which was writing a malloc implementation in C for a theoretical embedded system with limited page size- what the fuuuuuu... Guess I did need some CS after all. Anyway, since I knew very little about memory management (operating systems make it all nice for us with virtual memory and the like) I quickly wrote a crappy, naive implementation. We discussed memory fragmentation for a bit and how we could improve the system (honestly, I didn't know but I made something up). Then we discussed how to find bugs in software, my experience with debuggers (insufficient, probably) and finding exactly where in a long series of VCS commits a problem occurred (binary search through them).</p>
<p>I left that interview knowing I hadn't done well. There was little feedback from the interviewers, so the whole process felt like a kind of black box. Honestly the whole thing could have been done in an automated way just like the code screen since the interviewers let me use Google anyway. The first guy didn't even seem to want to talk much.</p>
<p>Got an email from the recruiter the following day saying I failed due to my sluggishness in reading and writing "simple" code. Yeah, ok. Not that I was never told that I needed to speed up, or how many more questions were left to go through. Essentially I completely misunderstood what kind of person they wanted for this job. They need someone who can rapidly process and mentally lint code and instantly throw down complete, efficient solutions under time pressure. Not at all unreasonable. I assume the software I use takes time and careful thought to produce, but maybe that's just naive.</p>
<p>Anyway, just a bit disappointing. I know interviewing is hard. Rant over.</p>
