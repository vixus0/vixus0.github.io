            <p>You know, I ask myself that same question sometimes. The simple answer is: I am a software developer based in London (the UK one). I've been writing code since I was a kid and now barely know how to do anything else.</p>
<p>Ok, I do enjoy doing a bunch of other stuff. Gaming, drawing, travelling, drinking, travelling and drinking, you get the idea. But I guess programming and everything that entails does occupy at least 70% (totally accurate, I swear) of my time. So you'll probably hear plenty about that.</p>
<p>So.. I hope to use this blog to discuss some interesting things with you. They might involve programming, they might not.</p>
